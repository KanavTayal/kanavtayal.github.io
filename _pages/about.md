👨🏻‍💻 I am a second-year graduate student at PEC, Chandigarh, specializing in Computational Fluid Mechanics.

🔬 My current research focuses on developing a Terminal Velocity tracking algorithm.

📚 I am passionate about contributing to the academic community, particularly in the fields of Machine Learning and computational research, and enjoy assisting others in their academic journeys.

🌐 I am enthusiastic about exploring advanced computational methods and their applications in fluid dynamics.

🤖 I actively engage in learning and experimenting with Machine Learning techniques to enhance research methodologies in my field.

📈 I am committed to continuous learning and collaborating with peers to solve complex problems and advance scientific understanding.

## 📜 Current Research Projects

1. **Bubble Tracking in Hele Shaw Cell**:
   - Developed an object detection algorithm to analyze bubble velocities in confined channels.
   - Research integrates OpenCV for frame analysis and scales measurements.
   - Potential applications in microfluidics and environmental engineering.

2. **CFD and Courant Number Analysis**:
   - Learning and applying numerical stability concepts for computational fluid dynamics.
   - Preparing to implement simulations using OpenFOAM and Basilisk C++ tools.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience

Currently, I am working as a **Student Researcher** at IIT Roorkee under the guidance of Prof. Das and Prof. Lokesh Rohilla, focusing on fluid mechanics. My research involves exploring **advanced computational techniques** and numerical simulations to enhance the understanding of fluid dynamics. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in bubble tracking within Hele Shaw cells, integrating OpenCV for **object detection** and **velocity analysis**, and applying concepts such as the Courant number for computational fluid dynamics simulations using tools like **OpenFOAM and Basilisk C++**.
