- This research investigates the motion and deformation of bubbles within confined Hele-Shaw cells, emphasizing their terminal velocity and interaction with fluid boundaries. Leveraging advanced object detection algorithms, the study employs precise computational tracking to analyze bubble trajectories and velocity profiles from high-resolution video data.

- Key findings reveal how confinement, bubble size, and fluid properties influence bubble behavior, offering new insights into fluid-bubble dynamics. By seamlessly integrating experimental observations with algorithmic analysis, the study establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding and manipulating bubble interactions. These insights have broad applications in microfluidics, biomedical devices, and related fields.
